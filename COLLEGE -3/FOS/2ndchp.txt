program is a set of instructions 

job is a sequence of single program

more than one program of single user is called task

when program is ready for execution it is called as process

program is passiv or static

process is active or dynamic

program whose execution overlap is 
called as concurrent process
It also means multiple process running at a time for better performance

process is created in new state and stored
in systems job pool/queue

the process changing its state is called as state transition

the process can change state when there is an event

the swapped out process is known as suspended process and it is called suspended queue

process control block is created 
when new process is created and deleted
as it terminates

Cpu register is used for execution of process

long term schedular is used to bring process from job pool to ready queue

short term schedular is invoked every time to select another process
if there is interrupt in running process

medium term schedulars to swap values from blocked processes

waiting time = completion time - Arrival time - execution time

Turn around time = waiting time + execution time

the fore and the first thing in the protocol is to identify the critical section
